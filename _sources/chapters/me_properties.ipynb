    "In this tutorial, we hope to track the evolution of the probability of finding a system in any of its available discrete states.\n",
    "As complex systems are often composed of ensemble of agents or parts, this tool will prove to be a powerful way of tracking their dynamics.\n",
    "It allows you to follow the distribution of possible compositions of the system over time, rather than simply following the average behavior of the system as is common in traditional mean-field approaches.\n",
    "[Predator-prey dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations), [birthâ€“death processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth%E2%80%93death_process), and [disease models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) on networks are only a few of the many applications unlocked by the tools covered in this tutorial."

    "A random discrete variable is completly described by its probability distribution $\\lbrace P_n\\rbrace_{n = 0}^\\infty$ over its set of possible states $n$. If that random discrete variable describes the behavior of a complex systems of interest, any tool that allows us to track its distribution through time $\\lbrace P_n(t)\\rbrace_{n = 0}^\\infty$ will prove invaluable. This is the objective of **master equations**. These are sets of differential equations describing the flows of probabilities associated with any state transitions of a system. As such, these are dynamical systems that respect basic properties of probabilities distributions"

Compartmental models often separate systems into their different types of parts and put those parts in boxes. Master equations separate a multiverse of systems into their different states and put systems in boxes. While we cannot reconstruct a system exactly from a compartmental models because of correlations between parts, master equations do not have that problem since they track the exact state of a system. To do so, master equations require a lot more equations than most compartmental models.\n",

    "There are a few standard ways of solving these equations and we will cover the two main approaches. First, we can computationally integrate the system of differential equations to track the distribution of states over time. This always works and is therefore the most common approach in research. For some systems however, a second approach can be used to get a more explicit solution: we can attempt to solve the system by finding a probability generating function describing the probability distribution $\\lbrace P_n \\rbrace$. We will cover both in what comes next!"
